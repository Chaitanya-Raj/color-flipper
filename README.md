# Color-Flipper

You click a button, the background color changes. Pretty basic stuff.

Just made this cause I was getting bored in quarantine.

Made this one to work with CSS animations, haven't paid much attention to them, was kinda busy with other stuff.

They're pretty neat though, a lil bit of code and boom, shitty webpage looks good lol.
